Scripts I use to setup my shell environment on a new machine.

Give it a go `curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sschlesier/shell-setup/main/shell-setup | sh`

To make iteration much faster I have used docker to develop these scripts.  The individual shell files are organized to enable effective layering of the docker image.  Final application is meant to be done via the above curl command on a new instance.
